#+TITLE: Collision detection and physics system demonstration

* Introduction
This is a simple non-interactable demo of a 2D collision detection and
constraint-based collision response system.

The collision detection system operates on three shape primitives: a
convex polyon, circle, and line segment. 



- Some structure based on Erin Catto's [[https://box2d.org/][Box2D]]
  - How friction is calculated
  - The structure and language of a collision "fixture"
  - Constraint-based collision resolution
    
- What mine doesn't have:
  - No "warm-starting"; that is, the constraints from the previous
    frame are not used in the current frame speed up iterative
    processes of determining impulses
- Seperating-axis theorem use for the collision routines involing convex polygons

* Dependencies
Building this project will require the rust compiler be installed in
the environment. The version used to build is specicially rust version
1.65, although previous version may work.

The graphics used in this demo are handled by SDL2, which is also required to be
installed to run this project.

* How to run
Navigate to the directory containing this README in a terminal and
type "cargo run" and the physics_tester and its dependencies
will build and then run a non-interactable physics scene.
